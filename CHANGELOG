New features:
	+ Demo mode: activates when there is no connection at the start moment
	+ Saving PID configuration in MCU's EEPROM
	+ Input new IP/PORT, save them on PC under any OS (by QSettings)

Changes:
	~ When connection with MCU lost MessageWindow appears only once: after that there is only statusbar message
	~ Graphics moved in module 'miscgraphics' (refresh PicButton, matplotlib Graph, MessageWindow)
	~ MCUconn module renamed to 'mcuconn', nice improvements in architecture, 'connection lost' handling, new functions
	~ Improvements in main module architecture (FormWidget class is now a part of MainWindow class; import only used names)
	~ Variables and functions names refactoring
	~ Other nice small changes
